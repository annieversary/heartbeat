* heartbeat
service inspired by [[https://github.com/5ht2b/heartbeat][5ht2b/heartbeat]] (and its rust reimplementation, [[https://github.com/lmaotrigine/heartbeat][lmaotrigine/heartbeat]]).
this is much less robust and feature complete, so do check out the other options!

from the original readme:
#+begin_quote
Works by pinging the server every minute, from any device, as long as said device is unlocked and being used (ie, you typed or used the mouse in the last two minutes).
#+end_quote

my version only supports sqlite since that's all i really care about

** configuration
create a =.env= file:
#+begin_src
# only sqlite is supported
DATABASE_URL=sqlite://db/database.sqlite

PORT=3000
#+end_src

to create a device, open the database manually, and create a device:

#+begin_src sql
insert into devices (name, token) values ("my device", "supersecrettoken");
#+end_src

once the server is running, you can ping the server and create a beat by

#+begin_src
curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: supersecrettoken http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/beat
#+end_src
